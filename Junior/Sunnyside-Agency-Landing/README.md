## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I took this on because I wanted more practice handling a full landing page.

Although not required, I added a sticky header with the same technique I used on my first ever project.

This time I learned that `scroll-behavior: smooth` is more widely adapted by browsers, so I opted to use that instead of the custom script I made in my previous project.

### Continued development

If I had the chance, I would have liked to work with more modern image file formats like webp. Also, I'd like to try more advanced methods of lazy loading.
