## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- (Updated 02/26/2023) - BEM

### What I learned

- I learned:

  - how to crop images and shift its position within a container, using object-fit: cover and object-position

  - to set a max-width so that the card won't stretch too much on bigger screens, and would shrink on smaller ones.

  - that along with `gap`, I can add `margins` or `paddings` to better match the design mockup.

  - how to hide a tooltip in a mobile layout, by positioning it `absolute` and giving it a `z-index` of `-1`, then reversing that via trigger. I also learned how to measure and adjust its height so that the card won't change dimensions when triggered.

  - to remember to set the overflow to visible when making a tooltip that overlaps the main nesting div.

  - how to set the little arrow of the tooltip ðŸ˜†. it's actually setting solid `border` but making three out of four edges `transparent`.

  - Making the tooltip overflow the card while maintaining the `border-radius` on the picture side was harder than I thought. I set the card's `overflow` to `visible`, and added `border-radius` and `overflow` attributes to the image's container. I adjusted that container's width until it matches the width of the image.

  - (Update 02/26/2023) - As I removed the unnecessary div that nested my img, I realized that I don't have to use `overflow` rules at all. I could just set a `border-radius` on the card, and then give a matching border radius pixel value to the img itself.

### Continued development

- I should improve:

  - my routine of doing the css styles. It's still too scattered for me.

  - my routine of matching dimensions. I could look at Chrome Developer to get the exact pixels instead of just randomly setting the sizes until it fits.

  - how modular my code is. It's good practice to do these from scratch, but when it's time to build a full webpage, I want to speed it up by copying and pasting templates I made.

(Update 02/26/23):

- After learning about BEM, I revised this and three previous projects to follow that convention. I think that this makes the code more uniform and easier to follow.

- While renaming classes, I also took out some redundant code. I realized that I habitually put things in `div`s and flexboxes, and assigning `justify-content` and `align-items` when there's no need. I have to stop being so decadent with that!
