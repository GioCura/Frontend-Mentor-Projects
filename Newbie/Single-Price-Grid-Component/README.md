## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I chose to do this project because I wanted to practice using `grid`. All this time, I've gotten by using `flex`, but I know that I'd better master `grid` if I ever want to make more asymmetrical layouts.

For this one, I practiced using the `grid-template-areas` property to make the desktop version. I learned that alongside that, I can still use `grid-template-columns` to distribute the spacing.

### Continued development

More practice using `grid`, and its more advanced properties.
