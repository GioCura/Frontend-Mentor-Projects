## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

- Making this project was straightforward, as I already know that I can achieve the card layout by using flex.

- Again, most of my effort went into making this responsive. At first, I thought about setting the cards all into a single row, but that didn't look good in my opinion. I eventually figured out that I could just set `clamp` to the cards' height.

- Really, I feel like this would have been a great opportunity to practice grid.
