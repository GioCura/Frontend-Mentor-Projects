### What I learned

I took on this project to practice using `background-image` for image components like these on cards. Looking back at my old udemy project, I realized how valuable it is to set `background-size` to `cover` and `background-position` to center.

After that, I just give my image box a set height.

Another thing, though. Despite setting `background-size` to `cover`, sometimes there will be a bit of whitespace that appears around the image. I've learned from my previous profile card project that a solution to this would be to give the container of the `background-image` a matching `background-color`.

### Continued development

I have to come back to a few of my previous projects to redo the background images from using `<img>` to `background-image`
